            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is having one main repository for all of the project files. This is done through a version control system (VCS). From the version control server, developers may check files out then make changes. After this they may check them back in, aka commit the files. Versioning control is great for offices and projects because it eliminates the file sharing problem. The nice thing about it is all the thigns it automatically notes, like the revision history, merging of the same files, and who changed what in the file. Versioning control is perfect for teams that are simultaneously editting files at the same time. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is an open sourced distributed version control system that has many benefits that makes the performance of it so great. There are three basic steps to GIT: Add, Commit, and Push. Although there are three basic steps of GIT, there are both basic and remote commands for using it. Some of the more important commands are "git init" which initializes the repository, "get add ." which adds all the files that were changed in the last back up, and "git commit -m"...."" which saves/commits all the changes to the repository.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Benefits of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is basically an opened sourced distributed version control system. GIT has the benefit of being very user friendly and easy to learn along with the fact that you can use it on both small and large projects. GIT also uses everything local and every user has their own copy of the repository locally stored on their own machine. Because of this, it makes it run much faster and it prevents an unintentional overwrite of files. GIT is definitely a great option for group projects because it is a distributed version control system, it has all the benefits of a normal version control system plus more! </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Other that elimnating the file sharing problem many experience, versioning control has many benefits in file sharing and editting. One of the main benefits is that files can not be overwritten, which is great for projects that have one file being worked on by multiple pepole. There is also a common repository that holds all the files, the latest versions, and it also allows you to revert back to an older version of a file is necessary. Something to think about if you aren't working collabratively is that a VCS allows for you to back up your files. All around VCS works for everyone.   </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Key GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In addition to the commands I listed in the section about GIT, there are many more commands for working with the repository. Anohter important one is "git push" which pushes the changes in the local repository to the remote one. Some other notable commands are "git log" which shows all the back ups created in the repository, "git status", which shows all the files that were changed since the last back up and which ones were added, and "git blame_" which shows who wrote what of the code. All of these commands play into the great functionality of a distributed version control system and how they are great of keeping track of changes in the files, what is different and who made it different. "git diff" is a great command for showing what is different between files. This is perfect for people working on the same files at different times so they can see what the other person has done. </p>
